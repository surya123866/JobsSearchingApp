2. **Session Management:**
   - Utilize `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to maintain the session for a logged-in user.

3. **Landing Page:**
   - Create a landing page with a single input asking the user what programming language they are looking for a job in.

4. **GitHub API Integration:**
   - Upon language selection, make a request to the GitHub public API to search for jobs that require developers with knowledge of the selected language.

5. **Job Listings:**
   - Display a list of job postings related to the selected language.

8. **Application Preview:**
   - After the user submits the application form, show them a success page with a preview of what their application looks like.
   - Use state management within the app to display this information.
